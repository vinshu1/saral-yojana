Limitations
The 90-minute version supports one scheme URL at a time.
Live scrape speed depends on the target page; some heavy government pages may time out.
Sarvam Translation input is truncated to ~3000 characters for speed.
Appointments are stored in-memory (resets on server restart). Swap for a database for production.
TTS output is one language + one voice at a time (user picks both).
---
Tips for a smooth demo
Pre-run the PM SVANidhi URL before demoing so the first load is cached.
Show the voice gender toggle — pick female for Hindi, male for English.
Switch to the Scholarships tab and click PMRF → shows the full pipeline reusing the explain endpoint.
Switch to Appointment tab → book a slot → show confirmation with Bengaluru address.
Emphasize the audio playback — that's the visible Sarvam value.
